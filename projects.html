		<h3>Adaptive Resource Allocation for Faster Formation of 6TiSCH IoT Networks</h3>	
		<p>The 6TiSCH (IPv6 over TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) is a wireless networking standard designed to provide IPv6-supported Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) communication for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and other critical applications. The formation of a 6TiSCH network is challenging due to the inherent channel hopping feature of TSCH, where new joining nodes do not know in which channel and at what time control packets are being transmitted by the already joined nodes. In addition, the resource allocation by the 6TiSCH-MC (RFC 8180) standard for network bootstrapping is static and does not provide any mechanism to handle congestion in the shared cell used for transmitting control packets. Moreover, the 6TiSCH-MC standard does not provide information regarding the transmission rates of different control packets used to form the network. Therefore, I have augmented the 6TiSCH-MC standard by introducing updated mechanisms to achieve faster formation of 6TiSCH IoT networks, including varying the beacon frame generation interval of the nodes <a href="" target="_blank">[1]</a>, enabling opportunistic <a href="" target="_blank">[2]</a> and fair <a href="" target="_blank">[4, 5]</a> channel access schemes, and providing mechanisms for utilizing all available physical channels <a href="" target="_blank">[3]</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">[7]</a>. I have also opened several research directions on the faster formation of 6TiSCH networks, such as 6TiSCH formation in the presence of malicious nodes, asynchronous networks, and SDN control traffic  <a href="" target="_blank">[6]</a>.  <a onclick="toggleInfo('Project1')" class="PDF_button magenta">Published Papers</a> </p>

			  <p>IEEE has standardized the 802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode to provide stringent latency, higher reliability, and low duty-cycle in various Internet of Things (IoT) applications. TSCH eliminates interference and multi-path fading on channels, but its channel hopping feature severely affects the 6TiSCH (IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode) network formation. Further, 6TiSCH Minimal Configuration standard does not provide sufficient bandwidth (i.e., minimal cell) for quick transmission of control packets required by the new nodes (i.e., pledges) during their network association. Many works have been proposed on 6TiSCH network formation as it has high impact on network performance and lifetime. However, the existing works either did not use all the available physical channels while allocating minimal cell(s) or are not stable with topology changes. Therefore, this work proposes a T ime-Variant RGB (TRGB) model for minimal cell allocation and scheduling, which results in faster association of pledges and maintains network stability. We evaluate the TRGB using Markov Chain model and also on a real 60-node testbed in FIT IoT-LAB. Testbed results show that TRGB achieves 51% and 23% improvement over the state-of-the-art scheme in terms of joining time and energy consumption, respectively, while maintaining stability of the network.</p>

			  <p>The IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode (6TiSCH) network is intended to provide reliable and delay bounded communication in multi-hop and scalable Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The IEEE 802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) link layer protocol allows the nodes to change their physical channel after each transmission to eliminate interference and multi-path fading on the channels. However, due to this feature, new nodes (aka pledges) take more time to join the 6TiSCH network, resulting in significant energy consumption and inefficient data transmission, which makes the communication unreliable. Therefore, the formation of 6TiSCH network has gained immense interest among the researchers. To date, numerous solutions have been offered by various researchers in order to speed up the formation of 6TiSCH networks. This article briefly discusses about the 6TiSCH network and its formation process, followed by a detailed survey on the works that considered 6TiSCH network formation. We also perform theoretical analysis and real testbed experiments for a better understanding of the existing works related to 6TiSCH network formation. This article is concluded after summarizing the research challenges in 6TiSCH network formation and providing a few open issues in this domain of work.</p>

			  <p>The 6TiSCH communication architecture is widely used in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to provide reliable, delay-bounded, and energy-efficient communication in multihop scenarios. However, the channel hopping feature and the resource allocation strategy of 6TiSCH minimal configuration (6TiSCH-MC) standard negatively impact the 6TiSCH network by increasing network formation time. 6TiSCH-MC allows only one cell (known as minimal cell) per slotframe to transmit control packets. When the number of joined nodes increases in the network, the formation time also increases because of the increasing congestion in the minimal cell. Furthermore, the existing works did not study the effect of transmission rates of all control packets together during 6TiSCH network formation. Therefore, in this work, a noncooperative game is formulated, for optimal transmission of control packets by the joined nodes. The obtained solution of the proposed game, using the Lagrange multiplier and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, is used in the proposed congestion control scheme—game theory-based congestion control (GTCC). GTCC calculates the slotframe window (SW) size for every node to control the congestion in minimal cell without any signaling overhead. GTCC is validated using the analytical model as well as the FIT IoT-LAB testbed. The findings of both the analytical and testbed experiments show that GTCC significantly reduces the joining time and energy consumption of new nodes (i.e., pledges) as compared to previous benchmark schemes.</p>

			  <p>The IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH) Working Group released 6TiSCH minimal configuration (6TiSCH-MC) standard for 6TiSCH network bootstrapping. 6TiSCH-MC allocates only one shared cell per slotframe, known as a minimal cell, to transmit all types of control packets. Our Markov Chain-based probabilistic analysis reveals that few network parameters have a high impact on the performance of 6TiSCH network formation due to increasing congestion in the minimal cell with the increased number of nodes. This work aims to improve the 6TiSCH network formation process by reducing congestion in the minimal cell. For this, the Trickle algorithm, which is used for controlling the rate of routing information-carrying packet transmission is modified so that sufficient routing information can be provided without congesting the minimal cell. To reduce the congestion further, a slotframe window (SW)-based adaptive scheme is proposed by which nodes are restricted to transmit their control packets frequently. The proposed dynamic Trickle algorithm and SW-based scheme are implemented on Contiki-NG and evaluated using FIT IoT-LAB testbed. The experimental results show that both the proposed schemes together improve the joining time and energy consumption of the pledges compared to the state-of-the-art schemes. Additionally, both the proposed schemes provide fair control packet transmission opportunities among the nodes in a network.</p>

			  <p>6TiSCH standardization helps the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to achieve reliable and timed data delivery. It also deals with minimal resource allocation during network formation. However, faster network formation using minimum resources remains an active research issue. 6TiSCH minimal configuration standard (6TiSCH-MC) recommends to use only one cell per slotframe known as the minimal cell for all the nodes to transmit their network bootstrapping traffic. It is observed that, including 6TiSCH-MC, the existing schemes did not use all the available cells, and so, all the physical channels at the timeslot where this minimal cell resides, i.e., at timeslot zero. It results in underutilization of channel resources, and thus, higher network formation time. To leverage the available cells at timeslot zero of each slotframe, and thus to improve the network formation performance, an autonomous allocation and scheduling of minimal cell (TACTILE) is proposed. The main challenge is to utilize the available cells at timeslot zero as there is a minimal cell already scheduled for network bootstrapping. To address this issue, TACTILE distributes the location of the minimal cell as per nodes' EUI64 addresses along the different physical channels followed by scheduling them intelligently to avoid de-synchronization among nodes. Combined with Markov chain-based theoretical analysis, evaluation of TACTILE is done on the FIT IoT-LAB real testbed. The testbed results show that TACTILE can achieve 87% and 42% improvements in terms of joining time and energy consumption, respectively, compared to 6TiSCH-MC.</p>

			  <p>Network bootstrapping is one of the initial tasks executed in any wireless network such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Fast formation of IIoT network helps in resource conservation and efficient data collection. Our probabilistic analysis reveals that the performance of 6TiSCH based IIoT network formation degrades with time because of the following reasons: (i) IETF 6TiSCH Minimal Configuration (6TiSCH-MC) standard considered that beacon frame has the highest priority over all other control packets, (ii) 6TiSCH-MC provides minimal routing information during network formation, and (iii) sometimes, joined node can not transmit control packets due to high congestion in shared slots. To deal with these problems, this article proposes two schemes—opportunistic priority alternation and rate control (OPR) and opportunistic channel access (OCA). OPR dynamically adjusts the priority of control packets and provides sufficient routing information during network bootstrapping, whereas OCA allows the nodes having urgent packet to transmit it in less time. Along with the theoretical analysis of the proposed schemes, we also provide comparison-based simulation and real testbed experiment results to validate the proposed schemes together. The received results show significant performance improvements in terms of joining time and energy consumption.</p>

			  <p>Industrial applications of Internet of Things (IoT) demand high reliability, deterministic latency, and high scalability with energy efficiency to the communication and networking protocols. 6TiSCH is a time slotted channel hopping (TSCH) medium access control (MAC) protocol running under the IPv6 enabled higher layer protocols for industrial IoT (IIoT). In this paper, we theoretically analyze the network formation protocol in 6TiSCH network. Analysis reveals that the performance of the 6TiSCH network degrades when a pledge (new node) joins as it increases channel congestion by allowing to transmit beacon message. On the other hand, beacon transmission is essential to expand or reorganize the present network topology. To overcome this performance tradeoff, a channel condition based dynamic beacon interval (C2DBI) scheme is proposed in which beacon transmission interval varies with channel congestion status during network formation. Channel congestion status is estimated by each joined node in distributed manner, and subsequently changes its beacon generation interval to best fit with present condition. Finally the performance of C2DBI is compared with the minimal configuration standard and few other benchmark protocols. Analytical, simulation and real testbed results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the state of the art protocols in terms of joining time and energy consumption during network formation.</p>

	      <h3>Routing Attacks on RPL-based IoT Networks and their Counter Measure</h3>
	      <p>IETF's IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) (RFC 6550) is vulnerable to several security threats, including sinkhole attack, sybil attack, hello flooding attack, wormhole attacks, and many more. Among these attacks, the DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) attack targets the service availability, specifically the energy consumption of legitimate nodes and network bandwidth exhaustion. Initially, I set up a testbed of 25 IoT devices (TI CC2650, CC2538, R-Pi) and experimentally evaluated the impact of the DIS attack during 6TiSCH network formation.

			  <p>The 6TiSCH communication architecture provides delay-bounded packet delivery, energy efficient, and reliable data-delivering communication in mission-critical Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It uses IETF’s 6TiSCH minimal configuration (6TiSCH-MC) standard for resource allocation during network formation and routing using a routing protocol for low power and lossy network (RPL) as routing protocol. In RPL, the DODAG information solicitation (DIS) control packet is used to solicit routing information from the existing networks. However, it is observed that malicious transmission of this DIS packet can severely affect the 6TiSCH networks in terms of nodes’ network joining time and energy consumption. Therefore, designing countermeasures of DIS attack in 6TiSCH network has become critically important. Additionally, the existing works neither considered all the possible parameters together for detecting DIS attack nor energy efficient, and create control packet overhead. In this work, we model noncooperative gaming to determine the optimal probability of responding to a DIS packet. Subsequently, we design a trust model to detect malicious DIS transmission in 6TiSCH networks. Finally, we merge both the proposed gaming model and trust model to propose a scheme—gaming and trust-based countermeasure (GTCM) to reduce the effect of DIS attack in 6TiSCH networks. We implement the GTCM on Contiki-NG and validate it using open source FIT IoT-LAB testbed. Our experimental testbed results show that GTCM reduces the effect of DIS attack in terms of pledges’ (new nodes) joining time and energy consumption significantly.</p>

			  <p>The 6TiSCH standard provides minimum latency and reliability in mission-critical IoT applications. To optimize resource allocation during 6TiSCH network formation, IETF released the 6TiSCH minimal configuration (6TiSCH-MC) standard. 6TiSCH-MC considered IETF’s IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy network (RPL) as a routing protocol for both upward and downward routing. In RPL, new joining nodes or joined nodes transmit DODAG Information Solicitation (DIS) requests to get routing information from the network. However, we observe that malicious node(s) can severely affect 6TiSCH networks by sending multiple DIS requests. In this letter, we show and experimentally evaluate on real devices the impact of the DIS attack during 6TiSCH networks formation. We show that the attacker does not need expensive resources or access to the network’s sensitive information to execute the DIS attack . Our testbed experiments show that the DIS attack significantly degrades the nodes’ joining time and energy consumption, increasing them by 34% and 16%, respectively, compared to normal functioning during 6TiSCH network formation.</p>

	  	<h3>Improving the performance of IoT Networks</h3>
		<p>Through experimental evaluations on the FIT IoT-LAB testbed, I observed that RPL-based LLNs suffer from load balancing issues caused by the default parent selection mechanism of the RPL routing protocol. As a result, overloaded nodes experience reduced lifetime due to increased energy consumption, and the throughput is significantly decreased due to frame discarding resulting from buffer overflow. Additionally, improper management of the limited queue/buffer size of the resource-constrained IoT nodes contributes to the degradation of LLN performance. Moreover, efficient and collision-free data transmission cell scheduling is crucial to ensure reliable communication among the nodes in IoT networks. With a large number of nodes having varying communication requirements and priorities, it becomes essential to efficiently schedule data transmission cells to avoid collisions, maximize channel utilization, and meet Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for different applications. As such, I have proposed schemes for load balancing and buffer management [INFOCOM-CNERT-WKSH'23] , and efforts are underway towards developing adaptive and autonomous cell scheduling strategies to improve IoT network performance, taking into consideration available bandwidth, network topology, and traffic load. </p>

  		<h3>Game theoretic Resource Allocation in Metaverse</h3>
		<p>Metaverse is a next-generation internet-based platform that enables virtual interaction between metaverse users and the living and non-living entities of the physical world in real-time. To facilitate real-time and seamless interaction between the physical and virtual worlds, the metaverse system requires the integration of various technologies such as sensing, communication, and high-computing devices. As metaverse is currently in its early stages, both QoS and QoE will play a significant role in its future adoption. However, the existing resource allocation techniques may not be adequate for metaverse due to its higher complexity, real-time, dynamic, interactive, and immersive nature. So far, I have formulated  a multi-leader and multi-follower based Stackelberg game for resource allocation among IoT devices and Virtual Service Providers (VSPs). The proposed game ensures a balance between the quality of data (i.e., QoE) and the cost and profit associated with data collection (i.e., revenue generated by the IoT devices). The proposed model has been solved using ADMM and simulated using MATLAB. The obtained numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. I am also working towards to provide cost-effective computational resource allocation among the cloud/edge service providers and VSPs depending on user requirements.</p>
